## Scripts

### build_interface_and_template.bash

Is to be used when changing either of the dependent projects:a-trade-microservice-runtime-api or
a-trade-microservice-template change.

It rebuilds both projects, publishes the api to local maven and move the artifact of template to the test/resource
folder for testing

### build_base_image.bash

This script updates dependencies and templates, compiles the project, and uses the production Dockerfile to create a
deployable Docker image from the most current build artifacts.
